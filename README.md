# PyPath Algorithms

The idea behind of this program is to implement a Path-Finding visualization program that implements different
path-finding algorithms to visualize.

This first commit only presents an implementation totally inspired on this video:

I will change it to implement many different algorithms.

## INSTALLATION

Use pipenv:

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
```

I'm using Python 3.9, but this should work with 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 as well.

Pygame 2 is used as well, but the code should be backwards compatible with pygame 1.9.x.
